# David Wetmore — Projects and Current Work

I build practical, well-documented software that blends AI-enabled apps with reliable deployment workflows.

## Projects

### [argocd-apps](https://github.com/dwetmore/argocd-apps)
**What it is:** An Argo CD app-of-apps control repo that bootstraps and manages multiple workloads from one declarative entrypoint.  
**What it does:** Defines child Argo CD Applications for services like chatbot, notes-app, GPU observability, space-invaders, and cmatrix; keeps cluster state converged to Git.  
**Why it is important:** It demonstrates platform-level GitOps orchestration and how to scale from single apps to a managed portfolio with consistent deployment patterns.

### [chatbot-gitops](https://github.com/dwetmore/chatbot-gitops)
**What it is:** A deployment-focused repository for running the chatbot stack on MicroK8s via Kubernetes manifests and overlays.  
**What it does:** Manages environment-specific configuration and rollout behavior for OpenWebUI + Ollama, enabling repeatable local cluster deployments.  
**Why it is important:** It separates delivery concerns from application code and shows production-style configuration discipline even in homelab/dev environments.

### [chatbot](https://github.com/dwetmore/chatbot)
**What it is:** A FastAPI-based chatbot backend project.  
**What it does:** Exposes API endpoints and service logic that can be deployed independently or integrated into larger conversational systems.  
**Why it is important:** It highlights API-first backend design and provides a clean Python service foundation that can evolve with model providers and product requirements.

### [cmatrix-web](https://github.com/dwetmore/cmatrix-web)
**What it is:** A containerized browser-accessible cmatrix experience built with Xvfb, x11vnc, and noVNC.  
**What it does:** Runs a terminal graphical workload in Kubernetes and serves it over HTTP so users can access it from any browser without local X11 setup.  
**Why it is important:** It demonstrates practical remote GUI packaging, container runtime behavior, and service exposure patterns for non-traditional workloads.

### [gpu-observability-gitops](https://github.com/dwetmore/gpu-observability-gitops)
**What it is:** A pure GitOps observability stack for NVIDIA GPU environments on MicroK8s.  
**What it does:** Deploys and configures DCGM exporter, Prometheus, Grafana, and logging components with custom dashboards and metric curation.  
**Why it is important:** It shows end-to-end GPU telemetry implementation and operational monitoring maturity, which is critical for AI/ML reliability and capacity planning.

### [notes-app](https://github.com/dwetmore/notes-app)
**What it is:** A FastAPI + PostgreSQL notes service with Kubernetes deployment assets and tests.  
**What it does:** Implements CRUD APIs, health/readiness endpoints, environment-driven DB backend selection, and deployable manifests for GitOps workflows.  
**Why it is important:** It demonstrates full-stack service engineering fundamentals: app logic, persistence behavior, test coverage, and deployment readiness.

### [space-invaders](https://github.com/dwetmore/space-invaders)
**What it is:** A Pygame game project adapted for containerized/Kubernetes execution.  
**What it does:** Provides an interactive game workload with deployment manifests and runtime tuning for consistent behavior across environments.  
**Why it is important:** It proves that interactive apps can be treated with the same delivery rigor as backend services, strengthening platform versatility.

### [dwetmore](https://github.com/dwetmore/dwetmore)
**What it is:** The portfolio/meta repository that documents and links the project ecosystem.  
**What it does:** Serves as the primary index for projects, current engineering focus, and public-facing technical narrative.  
**Why it is important:** It creates a single source of truth for project discovery and communicates architectural intent across the portfolio.

## Current Work (as of February 20, 2026)

- **argocd-apps (`main`)**: latest commit `77ee9ae` updates cmatrix deployment to `localhost:32000/cmatrix:novnc2`.
- **gpu-observability-gitops (`main`)**: latest commit `f78ad0a` expands GPU dashboard and aligns panels to supported DCGM metrics.
- **notes-app (`codex/fix-database-selection-logic-and-logging`)**: DB selection/overlay improvements in progress with local staged changes.
- **chatbot-gitops (`main`)**: migration cleanup state (dev-ollama patch files currently deleted locally).
- **dwetmore (`main`)**: portfolio repo with chatbot and notes project mirrors.

## Focus Areas

- Kubernetes + GitOps (Argo CD, Kustomize, Helm)
- GPU observability (DCGM, Prometheus, Grafana)
- Python services (FastAPI)
- Developer-focused demo apps and deployable workloads
